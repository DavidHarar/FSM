Feature selection is a crucial problem to tackle. Having too many features may lead to high training time and 
sub-optimal performence. 
This repository means to supplement the comprehensive blog post I wrote about the different methods for feature selection
and was published [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/feature-selection-for-the-lazy-data-scientist-c31ba9b4ee66).  
In the blog post, I present various methods that are based on different approaches, like correlations, information theory 
and distance.  
Different feature selectors are available for Python via different packages, some of which need to be better maintained. 
Therefore, in the current repo, I put them together in one place, fixing bugs and preparing a convenient wrapper two wrap 
them all in one class for convenient inference.
